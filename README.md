# Sanity_Test
Developed a high-accuracy classification model to predict sanity test failures by analyzing 12+ attributes and 50,000+ file changes. Applied NumPy, NLP (one-hot encoding, bag-of-words), and correlation analysis, achieving 97.18% accuracy with Soft Voting ensembles while enhancing reliability in low-failure scenarios.
